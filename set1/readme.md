TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

As this is **first** time for me to generate code with python, 

it was not easy for me to set up the dev environment by myself.

In addition to this, I had to join the tutorial online

due to the fact that I am an international student currently studying overseas.

*However*, while I was struggling with the basic instruction,

fellow students were kind enough to give a hand for me to follow up.

To conclude, I hope someday I could be the one that willingly helps out others who are in trouble.
