TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I thought that this week's exercises are pretty good to handle by myself until I encountered **exercise 3**.

Before I begin to write about exercise 3, I would like to describe the moment that I almost completed exercise 0, 1, and 2 and then my laptop got frozen.

No one knows why it occured. It just happened.

_However, this incident taught me the importance of saving your working file as many times as possible._

Anyway, about exercise 0, making the uppercase was a sort of challenge at first.

I googled it first and then applied a code. (I don't know why but I didn't tried many tests at the moment.)

Concerning exercise 1, it could be most easiest homework since all I have to do is just making comments on the codes.

While I found that exercise 2 was short enough to solve the problems, I get little confused about whitespaces.

After I realized that I need to add " " to make a space between two componants, I could also solve the problem that asked me to add a space from exercise 0.

Finally, **exercise 3**

_is_odd_ : had to print true if a_number is odd, therefore, I use % to divide into 2 so that if I get 1 as result, which means that it is an odd number.

For _fix_it_, I only used for loop to create 3 return statement. But I am not sure whether it works or not, if I use elif or else.

_loops_1a_: all I had to do was making a star list so I used for loop to do so.

_loops_1c_: it seemed little tricky at first sight. However,  

_loops_2_: I used for and range(). to make a square of star list and then used loops_1c to make a row of star list.

_loops_3_: In order to make a block of numbers, first, I generated empty list and then used for loop to iterate a sequence of numbers. Lastly, I used .append() to add a element to the lists.

_loops_4_: was very similar to loop_3. 

_loops_5_: still unfamiliar with {} bracket. but the strategy was almost same with other question.

_loops_6_: I was struggling with adding str() when I append j to the row list. In addition, I just used literal number in the range function. I will make up this later.

_loops_7_: I tried to make pyramid by using for loops and if statement.
