TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I thought that this week's exercises are pretty good to handle by myself until I encountered exercise 3.

Before I begin to write about exercise 3, I would like to describe the moment that I almost completed exercise 0, 1, and 2 and then my laptop got frozen.

No one knows why it occured. It just happened.

However, this incident taught me the importance of saving your working file as many times as possible. 

Anyway, about exercise 0, making the uppercase was a sort of challenge at first.

I googled it first and then applied a code. (I don't know why but I didn't tried many tests at the moment.)

Concerning exercise1, it could be most easiest homework since all I have to do is just making comments on the codes.
