TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I thought that this week's exercises are pretty good to handle by myself until I encountered **exercise 3**.

Before I begin to write about exercise 3, I would like to describe the moment that I almost completed exercise 0, 1, and 2 and then my laptop got frozen.

No one knows why it occured. It just happened.

However, this incident taught me the importance of saving your working file as many times as possible.

Anyway, about exercise 0, making the uppercase was a sort of challenge at first.

I googled it first and then applied a code. (I don't know why but I didn't tried many tests at the moment.)

Concerning exercise 1, it could be most easiest homework since all I have to do is just making comments on the codes.

While I found that exercise 2 was short enough to solve the problems, I get little confused about whitespaces.

After I realized that I need to add " " to make a space between two componants, I could also solve the problem that asked me to add a space from exercise 0.

Finally, **exercise 3**

The is_odd statement had to print true if a_number is odd, therefore, I use % to divide into 2 so that if I get 1 as result, which means that it is an odd number.

For fix_it, I only used for loop to create 3 return statement. But I am not sure whether it works or not, if I use elif or else.
