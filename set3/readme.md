TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**My Jounal**

_exercise 1_
loop_ranger: still wondering how i can generate this without using range function.

lone_ranger: As usual, started with empty list and then append i, which have been assigned the range.

two_step_ranger: As range(). function requires (start, stop, step), I assigned 2 in the step.

stubborn_asker: I have been struggling with this def since it is first time to use while loop for me. At first, I imported random to generate random number. And I need infinite loop which only ends if it achieves certain requirements. So I used **while true** and then wrote if statement to assign the condition.

not_number_rejector: still working on this def. Although I didn't use try and catch on this, I got a green tick from the test. I am wondering how I can throw non-number components.

super_asker: Finally, I could use try and except for this question. Following the guideline, I combined the strategy that I had used for this exercise. I imported random and used while loop. However, I still get a result that says invaild value, which means I have a error in value. Therefore, still have to look at this one.

_exercise 2_: I've written some notes on the exercise2.py.
